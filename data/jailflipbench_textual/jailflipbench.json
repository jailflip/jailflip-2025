    "note": "This is the instanced version of textual JailFlipBench, covering both the single-modal and factual extension scenario. In the full version of JailFlipBench, there will be 22 topics and 413 seed questions in total, with each seed question gone through groud truth augmentation (gt flip), 7 mutations (5 lingustic + 2 translation). Factual extension modification has also been conducted to those base-style questions, resulting in 413*2*(1+5+2)=6608 close-ended single-modal questions and 413*2=826 open-ended factual extension questions. Each seed question and its gt-flipped variants have been rigorously checked to ensure the JailFlip characteristic. Please refer to data/jailflipbench_mutlimodal folder to get the multi-modal version of JailFlipBench, and the full version of textual JailFlipBench will be released immediately once our paper is accepted.",
